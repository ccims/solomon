# SoLOMON
SoLOMON is a tool for SLO-based monitoring.

**Overview of the architecture:**

![Architecture overview](documentation/images/logical-view.png)

## Get it running (locally)
1. install dependencies for frontend and backend: `npm install` (in both: `/solomon-backend` and `/solomon-frontend`)
2. start backend: `npm run start:dev`  (in `/solomon-backend`)
3. start frontend: `npm run start`  (in `/solomon-frontend`)
4. for full functionality you also need to run an instance of the [Gropius backend](https://github.com/ccims/ccims-backend-gql) and set the URL where it is running in the SoLOMON env file (`/config/envs/.env.dev.local`).

Hint: _The backend can be started either as HTTP or as HTTPS server.
To start it as HTTP server just make sure that `HTTPS_ENABLED=false` is set in the env file (`/config/envs/.env.dev.local`).
If you want to run it as HTTPS server set `HTTPS_ENABLED=true` and follow the following instructions._


### Creating the SSL certificate
1. Create self-signed SSL certificate, using following commands (in Git Bash):
   1. `openssl genrsa -out key.pem`
   2. `openssl req -new -key key.pem -out csr.pem`
   3. `openssl x509 -req -days 9999 -in csr.pem -signkey key.pem -out cert.pem`
   4. `rm csr.pem`
2. After the third command you will be prompted to enter in different information for the certificate. You can just put in random information or even leave most of the fields empty. Don't set a challenge password!
3. When done you should find two files in the location where you executed the commands:
   1. `cert.pem`
   2. `key.pem`
4. Copy these files into the following location of the SLO backend folder: `/config/certificate/`

Hint: _Git comes with open-ssl, this is why this works in the Git bash but not in PS or CMD. Alternatively you can just generate the certificate in a Linux system and copy the files afterwards, or you could install open-ssl on Windows._

### Creating the user for Basic Authentication
1. create a new JSON file called `basic-user.json`
2. it should have the following format, but you can invent your own username and password:
`{ "users": { "yourusername": "yourpassword"} }`
3. put this JSON file into the following folder of the SLO backend: `/config/credentials/`


### Accessing the HTTPS server
When accessing the backend now, we have to use the HTTPS protocol in the URL and also add the basic auth user.
A call to the (locally deployed) backend from the browser might thus look like this:

`https://yourusername:yourpassword@localhost/solomon/rules/aws`

When using tools like Postman, there is an "Authorization" tab where the Basic Auth user can be specified once.
Postman then takes care of adding the user and password to each request and you don't have to add it to the URL manually.

## Foundations/Required Technologies

- Prometheus 
    - Read https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/
    - Add targets to be scraped
    - Define Alert Rules
    - Read about Alertmanager, Exporters and Blackbox Exporter
- Docker Basics: What are containers? What is `Dockerfile`
- Kubernetes Basics
    - Learn about Pods, Deployments, Services, Custom Resources Definitions (CRD
    - Learn about Helm Charts
- Frameworks React.JS and Nest.JS are being using but it is probably sufficient to know basics of JavaScript to understand the current code
- Learn about current System by reading and executing the following instructions

## Steps to Setup Kubernetes Cluster with SLA Management

Install Minikube to run a local Kubernetes cluster. Following steps uses Minikube and Helm.

1. Create new Minikube profile

`minikube start -p sla-management --cpus=2 --memory=2048`

2. Install kube-prometheus-stack helm chart with prometheus values. This sets up a basic prometheus environment

`helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts` then

`helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack  -f ./prometheus-operator-values.yaml`

3. Apply kubernetes resources in `kubernetes-environment` folder. This create sla-manager and nodejs-demo-client deployment & service and set roles.

`kubectl apply -f .`

4. Install Blackbox Exporter Helm Chart with values

`helm install blackbox-exporter prometheus-community/prometheus-blackbox-exporter -f ./blackbox-exporter-values.yaml`


Explanations: You have set up a kubernetes cluster, configures the prometheus operator, that is used to monitor pods of the cluster. You created deployments and services for 

1. `nodejs-demo-client`, a dummy server to be monitored by prometheus. This server exports metrics that can be monitored by prometheus. This is the common way to monitor applications with prometheus but it requires configuration on the application itself which is not optimal for our system. To solve this, we use the Blackbox Exporter to monitor Applications. This is a "prober" that sends HTTP request to the configured applications to check availability and response times (and more). 

2. As the name says, `sla-manager` manages the configured SLA's. It converts existing SLA's to prometheus rules using the `prometheusrules` CRD, which is being applied via the Kubernetes API (the "programmatically" method of defining a yaml rules file (see example `sla-rules.yaml`)). See `sla-rules.service.ts` in the `sla-manager/src` directory. It also handles the "Gropius Issue Creation", when a Prometheus Alert Rule get triggered, the Alert Manager is configured to send fired Alerts to the sla-manager service via webhooks. See `issue-manager.service.ts`.

3. The `sla-manager-frontend` is where you can configure SLA's.

## Installation with Helm

Add the Helm repo:

`helm repo add myrepo https://tobiasrodestock.github.io/Helm-chart`

Install with Helm:

`helm install solomon myrepo/solomon`



## How to use the System (provisionally)

Use port-forward to access sla-manager and sla-manager-frontend

`kubectl port-forward [Sla manager pod] 6400`

`kubectl port-forward [Sla Manager Frontend Pod] 3000`

Get familiar with Gropius. Start Backend and Frontend. Instructions at the corresponding Repos.

Now you can configure SLA Rules (by default one Rule is already configured).

Access prometheus to see the configured SLA Rules in action (names of pods might be different for you):

`kubectl port-forward prometheus-prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus-0 9090`

Also checkout Alert Manager and Blackbox Exporter

`kubectl port-forward alertmanager-prometheus-kube-prometheus-alertmanager-0 9093`

`kubectl port-forward blackbox-exporter-prometheus-blackbox-exporter-d94fc99c5-j8gn5 9115`

You can simulate an unavailable service by rescaling to 0 pods like this.

`kubectl scale --replicas=0 deployment/nodejs-client-deploy`

Now you will see the Alert Rules go to state `Active` (yellow) and the `Fire` (red), which means the Alert was triggered and send to SLA Manager via the Alertmanager. See logs of Alertmanager to check if it recieved the triggered Alerts:

`kubectl logs [SLA Manager Pod]`



# Current Issues and TODOs
## Frontend Related
- [ ] Errors are not shown in the frontend yet (e.g. "ExpiredToken: The security token included in the request is expired" when connecting to AWS or: "ValidationError: Period must be 10, 30 or a multiple of 60" when setting false period for AWS SLO)
- [ ] When an SLO is edited, but its name is changed, a new SLO gets created and the old one is not deleted

## AWS related
- [ ] Network Load Balancer targets for AWS can currently not be loaded, which makes it impossible to create SLOs for AWS Network Load Balancers

## Older
- [ ] SlaRule Serialization: When shutting down sla-manager, SLA's are not persistent and such not available when restarting service
- [ ] Blackbox Exporter needs probe targets configured in blackbox-exporter-values.yaml, solution: Probe crd but setup not working yet
